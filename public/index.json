Previous research has outlined the limitations of paper-based patient records, but few studies have examined their potential utility for improving management of hospital operations. The authors use data collected from paper registries in an Ethiopian obstetrics ward at Addis Ababa’s Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia’s largest university hospital, to model the ward’s operations. The article furthermore provides recommendations on how the obstetrics ward can incorporate the modelling approaches to their daily operations.","tags":["Decision Sciences Ethiopia","Mathematical Models","Operations Research","Maternal Mortality","Health Systems","Health and Medicine","Sub-Saharan Africa"],"title":"Modelling hospital operations: insight from using data from paper registries in the obstetrics ward at a hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1554595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554595200,"objectID":"690cde9752ab889afaab766dbb6ba9df","permalink":"/teaching/preprint/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/preprint/","section":"teaching","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In Ethiopia, medical impoverishment is found to be associated with illness occurrence and health services utilization. Although currently used estimates are sensitive to health services utilization, a systematic breakdown of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs by cause can provide important information for the design of health policies toward universal health coverage, reduction of direct OOP payments, and poverty alleviation.","tags":["Decision Sciences Ethiopia","Costing Methods","Health Systems","Health and Medicine","Sub-Saharan Africa"],"title":"Assessing the burden of medical impoverishment by cause: a systematic breakdown by disease in Ethiopia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mieraf Taddesse Tolla","Ole Fritjof Norheim","Solomon Tessema Memirie","Senbeta Guteta Abdisa","Awel Ababulgu","Degu Jerene","Melanie Bertram","Kirsten Strand","Stéphane Verguet","Kjell Arne Johansson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470960000,"objectID":"497bd217a0c77c4ae0f684ce073c5133","permalink":"/publication/2016_tolla_cardiovascular/","publishdate":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_tolla_cardiovascular/","section":"publication","summary":"This article, published in Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation, aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in an Ethiopian setting.
