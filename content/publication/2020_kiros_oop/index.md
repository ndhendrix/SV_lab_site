abstract: This article, published in Health Policy and Planning, estimates the incidence of catastrophic and impoverishing health expenditures using data from the 2015/16 Ethiopian household consumption and expenditure and welfare monitoring surveys. The authors compute the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) at 10% and 25% thresholds of total household consumption and 40% threshold of household capacity to pay. Impoverishing health expenditures (IHE) are calculated using Ethiopia's national poverty line (ETB 7184 per adult per year). The study finds that a large number of households face financial hardship in Ethiopia, particularly in Afar, Benshangul-Gumuz, Oromia, Amhara, and SNNP regions and this number will likely increase with greater health services utilization.
