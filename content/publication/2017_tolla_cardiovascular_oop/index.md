abstract: This article, published in BMJ Global Health, aims to estimate the magnitude and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and factors associated with CHE for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in hospitals in Addis Ababa. Seeking prevention and treatment services for cardiovascular disease in Addis Ababa was found to pose substantial financial burden on households, affecting the poorest and those who reside outside Addis Ababa more. Economic and geographic inequalities should therefore be considered when setting priorities for expanding coverage of these services. Expanded coverage must go hand-in-hand with implementation of sound prepayment and risk pooling arrangements to ensure financial risk protection to the most needy.
