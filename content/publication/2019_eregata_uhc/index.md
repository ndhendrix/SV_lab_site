abstract: "This article, published in BMJ Global Health, aims to estimate the 2015 national and subnational universal health coverage (UHC) service coverage status for Ethiopia. The UHC service coverage index is constructed from the geometric means of component indicators: first, within each of four major categories and then across all components to obtain the final summary index. The authors estimate UHC service coverage at the subnational level using a variety of surveys and routinely collected administrative data. The study finds that the overall UHC service coverage for Ethiopia was low in 2015 compared with most other countries in the region and that there is substantial variation between regions."
