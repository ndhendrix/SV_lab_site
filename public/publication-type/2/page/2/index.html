      <div class="article-style">
        
          This article, published in BMJ Global Health, aims to estimate the magnitude and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and factors associated with CHE for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in hospitals in Addis Ababa. Seeking prevention and treatment services for cardiovascular disease in Addis Ababa was found to pose substantial financial burden on households, affecting the poorest and those who reside outside Addis Ababa more. Economic and geographic inequalities should therefore be considered when setting priorities for expanding coverage of these services. Expanded coverage must go hand-in-hand with implementation of sound prepayment and risk pooling arrangements to ensure financial risk protection to the most needy.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          This article, published in BMJ Global Health, quantifies household out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure for treatment of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea and estimates its impact on poverty for different socioeconomic groups in Ethiopia. The study finds that wealthier and urban households have higher OOP payments, but poorer and rural households are more likely to be impoverished due to medical payments. The present circumstances call for revisiting the existing health financing strategy for high-priority services that place a substantial burden of payment on households at the point of care.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          This article, published in BMC Medicine, utilizes a cost and epidemiological model to propose an assessment of the burden of medical impoverishment in Ethiopia (i.e., the number of households crossing a poverty line due to out-of-pocket (OOP) direct medical expenses). Among 20 leading causes of mortality, the authors estimate the burden of medical impoverishment to be around 350,000 poverty cases, with the top three causes of medical impoverishment attributed to diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, and road injury. In Ethiopia, medical impoverishment is found to be associated with illness occurrence and health services utilization. Although currently used estimates are sensitive to health services utilization, a systematic breakdown of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs by cause can provide important information for the design of health policies toward universal health coverage, reduction of direct OOP payments, and poverty alleviation.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          This article, published in Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation, aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in an Ethiopian setting. Fifteen single interventions and sixteen intervention packages are assessed from a healthcare provider perspective. The results indicate that the escalating burden of CVD and its risk factors warrants timely action. Selected CVD intervention packages could be scaled up at a modest budget increase, but the level of willingness-to-pay has important implications for the interventions’ probability of being cost-effective. This study provides valuable evidence for setting priorities for the essential health services package in Ethiopia.

          This article, published in BMC Health Services Research, aims to measure changes in inequality in access to maternal and child health (MCH) interventions and the effect of primary health care (PHC) facilities expansion on the inequality in access to care in Ethiopia. The authors utilize Demographic and Health Survey datasets from Ethiopia (2005 and 2011) to calculate changes in utilization of MCH interventions and child morbidity and estimate concentration and horizontal inequity indices. The findings suggest that expansion of PHC facilities in Ethiopia might have an important role in narrowing the urban-rural and rich-poor gaps observed in health service utilization for selected MCH interventions.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          This article, published in Health Policy and Planning, utilizes an extended cost effectiveness analysis (ECEA) to examine how policies to expand access to surgery in rural Ethiopia would impact health, impoverishment, and equity. The study finds that health benefits, financial risk protection, and equity appear to be in tension in the expansion of access to surgical care. Health benefits from each of the examined policies accrue primarily among the poor, but without travel vouchers, many policies also induce impoverishment among the poor while providing financial risk protection to the rich. These findings call into question the equitable distribution of benefits by these policies.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          This article, published in PLOS ONE, conducts an extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) of two fully publicly financed interventions in Ethiopia: pneumococcal vaccination for newborns and pneumonia treatment for under-five children. The authors apply ECEA methods and estimate the program impact on: (1) government program costs; (2) pneumonia and pneumococcal deaths averted; (3) household expenses related to pneumonia/pneumococcal disease treatment averted; (4) prevention of household medical impoverishment; and (5) distributional consequences across the wealth strata of the population. The results indicate that vaccine and treatment interventions for children can bring large health and financial benefits to households in Ethiopia, most particularly among the poorest socio-economic groups.

          Using extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA), this paper evaluates the health and economic implications of different vaccine delivery strategies in Ethiopia: (1) routine immunization, (2) routine immunization with financial incentives, and (3) mass campaigns, known as supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), for measles vaccination. At higher costs, SIAs reached higher levels of vaccine coverage. Routine immunization paired with financial incentives was found to increase the demand among poorer households.

          This article, published in BMJ Open, aims to illustrate the size and distribution of benefits due to the treatment and prevention of diarrhoea (i.e., rotavirus vaccination) in Ethiopia. The authors use an economic model to examine the impacts of universal public finance (UPF) of diarrhoeal treatment alone, as opposed to diarrhoeal treatment along with rotavirus vaccination using extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA). The study finds that diarrhoeal treatment paired with rotavirus vaccination is more cost effective than diarrhoeal treatment alone for the examined metrics (deaths and private expenditures averted). Policymakers should consider multiple benefit streams as well as their scale and incidence when considering public financing of health interventions.
