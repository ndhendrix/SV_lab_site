This resource pack was developed by Dr. St√©phane Verguet at the Center for Health Decision Science. The Disease Control Priorities-Ethiopia (DCP-E) project, sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, brings evidence and methods of priority setting and health economics closer to policy decision-making in Ethiopia.
