abstract: This article, published in BMJ Global Health, provides experiences of country contextualisation of WHO-CHOICE methods and models to a country level. Results from three contextualised cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are presented, and the authors discuss how this evidence can inform priority setting in Ethiopia. This method of contextualised CEAs requires inclusion of national analysts and use of country-specific inputs for either costs, epidemiology, demography, baseline coverage or effects. Rank ordering of interventions by incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), together with presentations of expected budgetary impact and net health benefits, is a clear and policy-friendly illustration of possible efficient stepwise pathways towards universal health coverage (UHC).
