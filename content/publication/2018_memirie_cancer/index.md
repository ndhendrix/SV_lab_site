abstract: This article, published in the Journal of Global Oncology, utilizes primary data from the Addis Ababa population-based cancer registry, as well as supplementary cancer data from six Ethiopian regions to estimate the incidence rates of the most common forms of cancer diagnosed in Ethiopia. The study finds that cancer, most prominently breast cancer, poses a substantial public health threat in Ethiopia. The fight against cancer calls for the expansion of population-based registry sites to improve quantifying cancer burden in Ethiopia and requires both increased investment and application of existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the Ethiopian population.
