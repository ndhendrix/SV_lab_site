abstract: This article, published in Health Policy and Planning, examines the cost-effectiveness of several maternal and neonatal health (MNH) interventions in an Ethiopian setting. The authors employ a static life table model to estimate the health impact of a 20% increase in intervention coverage relative to baseline. The results indicate that many MNH interventions are highly cost-effective. This evidence can be useful in informing the ongoing essential health services package revision in Ethiopia.
