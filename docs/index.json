HIV and TB are found to cause substantial economic burden and CHE, inequitably affecting those in the poorest income quintile.

The study results indicate that in Ethiopia, geographic HIV clusters are driven by different risk factors.

Among 20 leading causes of mortality, the authors estimate the burden of medical impoverishment to be around 350,000 poverty cases, with the top three causes of medical impoverishment attributed to diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, and road injury. In Ethiopia, medical impoverishment is found to be associated with illness occurrence and health services utilization. Although currently used estimates are sensitive to health services utilization, a systematic breakdown of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs by cause can provide important information for the design of health policies toward universal health coverage, reduction of direct OOP payments, and poverty alleviation.","tags":["Decision Sciences Ethiopia","Costing Methods","Health Systems","Health and Medicine","Sub-Saharan Africa"],"title":"Assessing the burden of medical impoverishment by cause: a systematic breakdown by disease in Ethiopia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mieraf Taddesse Tolla","Ole Frithjof Norheim","Solomon Tessema Memirie","Senbeta Guteta Abdisa","Awel Ababulgu","Degu Jerene","Melanie Bertram","Kirsten Strand","Stéphane Verguet","Kjell Arne Johansson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470960000,"objectID":"c144b0a5583107f190927959c7ac490e","permalink":"/publication/tolla_cost_prevention_2016/","publishdate":"2016-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tolla_cost_prevention_2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Decision Sciences Ethiopia"],"title":"Prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in Ethiopia: a cost-effectiveness analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Solomon Tessema Memirie","Stéphane Verguet","Ole Frithjof Norheim","Carol E Levin","Kjell Arne Johansson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1455235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1455235200,"objectID":"a1d495b9d9c8766477ef533ed369f488","permalink":"/publication/2016_memirie_maternal/","publishdate":"2016-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_memirie_maternal/","section":"publication","summary":"This article, published in BMC Health Services Research, aims to measure changes in inequality in access to maternal and child health (MCH) interventions and the effect of primary health care (PHC) facilities expansion on the inequality in access to care in Ethiopia.
