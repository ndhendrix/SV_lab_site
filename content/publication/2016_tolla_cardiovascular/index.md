abstract: This article, published in Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation, aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in an Ethiopian setting. Fifteen single interventions and sixteen intervention packages are assessed from a healthcare provider perspective. The results indicate that the escalating burden of CVD and its risk factors warrants timely action. Selected CVD intervention packages could be scaled up at a modest budget increase, but the level of willingness-to-pay has important implications for the interventions’ probability of being cost-effective. This study provides valuable evidence for setting priorities for the essential health services package in Ethiopia.
