abstract: This article, published in BMJ Open, aims to estimate the household economic burden and incidence of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) incurred as a result of HIV and TB care across income quintiles in Ethiopia. The economic burden of HIV and TB care is estimated looking at direct and indirect costs, whereas the incidence of CHE is determined using direct costs that exceed 10% of the household income threshold. HIV and TB are found to cause substantial economic burden and CHE, inequitably affecting those in the poorest income quintile. Broadening health policies to encompass interventions that reduce the high cost of HIV and TB care, particularly for the poor, is urgently needed.
