abstract: "Using extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA), this paper evaluates the health and economic implications of different vaccine delivery strategies in Ethiopia: (1) routine immunization, (2) routine immunization with financial incentives, and (3) mass campaigns, known as supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), for measles vaccination. At higher costs, SIAs reached higher levels of vaccine coverage. Routine immunization paired with financial incentives was found to increase the demand among poorer households."
